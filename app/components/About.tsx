        I’m a Computer Science Engineering student at RGIPT (CPI 9.20),
        passionate about building full-stack apps, real-time communication
        systems, and AI-driven tools.  
        <br />
        I’ve solved 800+ DSA problems, earned the Knight Badge (Top 5%) on
        LeetCode, and love architecting systems that scale.
